# Self-driving Car
![](/images/pic01.jpg)

**Project Summary**

- Trained CNN to identify common traffic signs and trained a Machine Learning architecture based on The Nvidia Model to predict steering angles of a single laned road
- Utilized a lane detection algorithm to detect lanes and drive the car maintaining mid lane steering using PID control
- Equipped Raspberry Pi as the main processing unit and used it to communicate with Pi camera and motors
- Used Lidar to accurately detect nearby objects and take actions accordingly
